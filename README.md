 My first repo
 ...now updated with some changes

 Here are some more changes.

 Some more changes to create a branch.


It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight"
Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight

 Each time the wind blows
 I hear your voice so
 I call your name
 Whispers at morning
 Our love is dawning
 Heaven's glad you came
 You know how I feel
 This thing can't go wrong
 I'm so proud to say I love you
 Your love's got me high
 I long to get by
 This time is forever
 Love is the answer
 I hear your voice now
 You are my choice now
 The love you bring
 Heaven's in my heart
 At your call
 I hear harps
 And angels sing
 You know how I feel
 This thing can't go wrong
 I can't live my life without you
 I just can't hold on
 I feel we belong
 My life ain't worth living
 If I can't be with you
 I just can't stop loving you
 I just can't stop loving you
 And if I stop
 Then tell me just what will I do
 'Cause I just can't stop loving you
 At night when the stars shine
 I pray in you I'll find
 A love so true
 When morning awakes me
 Will you come and take me?
 I'll wait for you
 You know how I feel
 I won't stop until
 I hear your voice saying
 "I do"
 "I do"
 This thing can't go wrong
 This feeling's so strong
 Well, my life ain't worth living
 If I can't be with you
 I just can't stop loving you
 I just can't stop loving you
 And if I stop
 Then tell me, just what will I do
 I just can't stop loving you

 We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do
